<b>What is your company going to make</b><br><br>

HireReady is an online and offline education platform teaching vocational skills to individuals looking to work, starting in hospitality and food services. We are addressing a knowledge gap starting in the US where 60% of Americans, without a college degree, lack occupational skills and can&#39;t find a job. Companies pay for and hire from our trained candidates because they are certified and ready to work, eliminating the recruiting and training pain points that cost them $5B annually. <br><br>
<b>Where do you live now, where would the company be based?</b><br><br>

San Francisco, CA<br><br>

<b>Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outside of class or work, that two or more of you created together. Include urls if possible.</b><br><br>

Dan and Arjun created an automated system to suggest picks for their fantasy football team. The script populated data from espn.com in a spreadsheet and ranked individual players based on their past performance as well as the performance of upcoming opponents. We beat out 30 other teams and won $1000.<br><br>
<b>How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?</b><br><br>
The last 2+ years we worked closely together at Homejoy as the earliest employees. We all went to MIT and Daniel and Arjun have known each other since high school.<br><br>
<h2>Progress</h2><br>
<b>How far along are you?</b><br><br>

Since inception 6 weeks ago, we&#39;ve acquired 300 users, certifying 20 of them for cleaning jobs with Homejoy, netting $10k. We&#39;re negotiating next steps with them to onboard more candidates and expand to other markets. We&#39;ve also secured 3 partnerships with employment development offices, supplying candidates for us to train. 

During this past week, we&#39;ve developed the web app, including multiple applicant / employer conversion flows, email / SMS programs, referral programs, and our training management system. We&#39;ve branched out into food services, training 25 kitchen staff for 6 restaurants. We&#39;ve also started to explore opportunities in construction and private security by aggregating content, talking to unions, construction foremen, companies like PlanGrid, and launching test campaigns to gauge interest from both employees and employers. 
<br><br>
<b>If you&#39;ve already started working on it, how long have you been working and how many lines of code (if applicable) have you written?</b><br><br>
6 weeks. ~2KLOC.<br><br>
<b>If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.</b><br><br>

<h2>Idea</h2><br>
<b>Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you&#39;re making?</b><br><br>

We wanted to solve our biggest problem at Homejoy where 99% of cleaner applicants were unqualified which drove acquisition costs and churn rate up. We are expanding past cleaning to areas like food services, private security, and construction where upwards of 30% of job openings are left unfilled because applicants lack baseline skill. There is increasing demand for workers in these fields that won&#39;t be automated in the next couple decades. Countries like India and China are already migrating away from higher education in favor of vocational trade schools to fill open positions and get people working.<br><br>

Each of us is an expert in creating and operating systems to train and manage thousands of workers in this demographic, and grew Homejoy since city #1. There is demand for this product on both sides of the service because businesses have paid us over $10,000 recurringly in 6 short weeks and our referral rate from graduates of our program is over 60%. <br><br>

<b>What&#39;s new about what you&#39;re making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn&#39;t exist yet (or they don&#39;t know about it)?</b><br><br>
 
Job-seekers: Online schools and degree programs that exist are unattractive because of the time and cost, and there is no promise of work once completed. Recruiting platforms don&#39;t improve the candidate eligibility or skill level, which is why candidates currently apply to hundreds of jobs at a time. Our programs are designed with the job-seeker in mind so they can get trained and interview with a company quickly.<br><br>

Employers: For each position, companies spend hundreds of dollars posting multiple times on Craigslist and job boards. After factoring in all costs such as ATS fees, time, and resources to process and train applicants, the total spent often exceeds $1,500 per position and there is still uncertainty around quality and retention. HireReady provides companies trained workers that are ready to start, cutting down time and costs, which they pay a premium for.<br><br>

<b>Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?</b><br><br>

Craigslist has the largest supply of job-seekers so employers use it to source applicants. HigherMe and Workpop help hiring managers sort through the applicants, and LearnUp provides video training for customer service jobs in retail.  All of these lack the personal interaction we provide that resonates well with this demographic for whom a hands-off technology platform can be intimidating.<br><br>

Government agencies like the Dept. of Labor&#39;s Job Corps focus on training but are outdated and unintuitive. University of Phoenix and MOOCs like Platzi and Udemy teach skills online, but not for vocational topics. <br>

Our biggest fear is that companies further take recruiting and training in-house because they do not fully realize the true cost of onboarding an employee. <br><br>
<b>What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don&#39;t get?</b><br><br>

The most common reason people don&#39;t get hired is due to lack of experience, not for lack of job openings or recruiting/matching/ATS services. This applicant base needs to be created and refined quickly via training, not more applications.<br><br>

Businesses have specific needs and spend time and money to find someone to start ASAP, not 30 days from now. To a hiring manager, no previous experience means lots of hands-on, basic training. Recruiting companies, job boards, and applicant tracking systems ignore this. When searching for a job or starting a new trade, candidates need a way to get essential skills and businesses want a stamp of approval before hiring. <br><br>

<b>How do or will you make money? How much could you make?</b><br><br>
1) Companies currently pay us for trained applicants ready to work [$50-500]. 2) Job-seekers can pay for online training (currently free) depending on the intensity and length of the course [$5-$500 per certification]. <br><br>

There are 20M Americans without a college degree who are unemployed and looking for work. At an average of $150 per hire (student + company fees), that&#39;s $3B. The average American now works 20+ jobs in a lifetime, and rising. Placing a candidate 3 times yields a $10B opportunity. This number can expand further by training already-hired employees on behalf of companies, expanding into other industries, and moving globally. <br><br>

<b>How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won&#39;t be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?</b><br><br>

On the business side we have Homejoy as a client. We scraped craigslist, cold-called and went door-to-door to get restaurants looking for trained kitchen staff so our graduates would have a job. Job-seekers find us through online job-boards, numerous employment and development offices, community organizations and referrals. 
At Homejoy we learned to balance growth in a marketplace, the dropoff to expect, and its impact on user experience. With no money spent we&#39;ve had more than 350 job-seekers, 6 restaurant clients, and 100% candidate placement into jobs that generated $10,000 of profit. Tests in paid advertising also yielded profitable user acquisition on the job-seeker side.<br><br>
<h2>Equity</h2><br><br>
 
<b>Have you incorporated, or formed any legal entity (like an LLC) yet?</b><br><br>
No.<br><br>
<b>If you have not formed the company yet, describe the planned equity ownership breakdown among the founders, employees and any other proposed stockholders.</b><br><br>

33.3/33.3/33.3<br><br>

<b>Please provide any other relevant information about the structure or formation of the company.</b><br><br>
n/a<br><br>

<h2>Legal</h2><br>
 
<b>Are any of the founders covered by noncompetes or intellectual property agreements that overlap with your project? If so, please explain.</b><br><br>
No<br><br>
<b>Was any of your code written by someone who is not one of your founders? If so, describe how can you legally use it.</b><br><br>
Any unoriginal code was produced from open source projects<br><br>
 
<b>Is there anything else we should know about your company?<br>
(Pending lawsuits, cofounders who have left, etc.)</b><br><br>
No<br><br>
<b>If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we&#39;ve been waiting for. Often when we fund people it&#39;s to do something they list here and not in the main application.</b><br><br>
<ul>
<li>Help independent contractors monetize their downtime (increase their utilization between jobs)</li><br>
<li>in-car ad network utilizing Uber and Lyft drivers</li><br>
<li>Rent the Runway for ethnic clothing</li><br>
<li>a large digital ad network for public restrooms</li><br>
<li>funeral / death / estate planning</li><br><br>
</ul>
 
<b>Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered.</b><br><br>
Prototyped time-released caffeine beads within melatonin capsules to take quick power naps. Never made it past sample production because the effects were inconsistent on Arjun and he couldn&#39;t convince people to try it. <br><br>
<b>What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator?</b><br><br>

At Homejoy, Adora taught us to have a singular focus and to work towards that goal until we accomplished it. We would like to experience that as a team all over again at YC firsthand with HireReady.<br><br><br><br>
